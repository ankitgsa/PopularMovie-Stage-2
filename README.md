# PopularMovie-Stage-2
Welcome back to Popular Movies! Added functionality to the app built in Stage 1. More information to  movie details view added: User can view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser). Users can read reviews of a selected movie. Users can mark a movie as a favourite in the details view by tapping a button. This is for a local movies collection that user will maintain and does not require an API request*. User can modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favourites collection. Lastly, it is optimized for tablet experience.
